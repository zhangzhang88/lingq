Here's the story of a family getting a dog for the first time.

My son had never had a dog before.

Then, he got a dog named Max.

My son loved Max very much.

Max was a small, cute dog.

He used to like to run and play when he was a puppy.

My son and Max always played together.

Max liked to get dirty.
