        content: `Hi, this is Steve Kaufmann Founder of LingQ and I'm going to speak to you about the Seven Secrets to Successful Language Learning.

I have learned 11 languages, four of them since the age of 50. I'm working on my 12th, which is Korean. I will tell you what works for me; you'll have to decide if this can work for you. The first secret to successful language learning is spend the time.

When I study a language, I spend at least an hour a day trying to learn that language and I know that it's going to take me months and months of continuous studying to learn the language. But when I say study, I don't mean sit in a classroom, I don't mean answer questions or drills, review grammar rules or review lists of words, what I mean is spend time with the language. Be with the language, so listen to the language, read things that are written in the language or listen to songs that are sung in the language, watch movies if you can.

If you have friends who speak the language, spend time with them, even if most of the time you're just listening because you don't speak well enough to really say very much, Spend time with the language, that is the first secret and I say at least an hour a day.

It's not difficult to do because nowadays we have these very convenient little listening devices, like an iPod or an mp3 player which can carry vast libraries of interesting content that you can easily download from the internet or from wherever you want to find them. This is very different from many years ago. So when I say spend time with the language, the time we spend in the classroom almost doesn't count.

What matters is how much time do you spend away from the classroom with the language? The classroom can be very important as a place for you to meet with your friends, to find stimulus from a teacher, but in the classroom you're listening to the teacher half the time or you're listening to your classmates, some of whom might be better than you. In which case, you're afraid to speak up. Some of them are worse than you and so you find it annoying to listen to them, perhaps, I know I do. The important thing is how much time you spend with the language away from the classroom, listening, reading, watching movies, listening to songs, talking to people.

Spend that time with the language, do it month after month after month and don't let too many days go by where you don't spend time with the language. Depending how difficult the language is, that means how different it is from your native language or from a language you already speak, the amount of time required might be years. If you can only spend an hour a day, it could be six months to a year, two years. If you can spend three hours a day, then it might be less than a year, but it does take time. There is no shortcut to fluency. So my first secret and it's absolutely essential.

If you're going to make any progress in language learning, spend time with the language. So that's secret No. 1 and I will continue on to the other six secrets. There are a total of seven secrets to successful language learning. Thank you for listening.`,

        content: `Hi, this is Steve Kaufmann again talking about the Seven Secrets to Successful Language Learning.

You'll remember the first secret was to spend the time, every day if possible, and for a long enough period of time to achieve your goals. The second secret, in my opinion, is to do what you like doing. This is very important. If you don't enjoy studying the language you won't put in the time, so it's important that you do the things that you like doing.

Now, I can tell you what I like doing, but I can't tell you that you should do what I like doing because you may not like doing them.

What I like doing, what I think is extremely effective, is listening and reading. I think that when you are listening and reading you're relying entirely on your imagination to convert all these words into meaning. To me, that is a more intense learning environment than say watching videos, but there are other people who like to watch videos and who will watch videos over and over again.

I can't do that, so it's not something that I should do because I don't like doing it.

Similarly, someone who doesn't like listening or reading, to my mind, they're missing out on something. They'd probably feel the same with me about not watching videos, but they should then do what they like to do. I see advice, I should

I'll continue a little bit on the listening and reading and my strategy there.

When I start out with a language I will listen quite often to short bits of content until I understand 50, 60, 70%, then I'll move on to the next item. So I listen quite often to beginner content. I always want to read whatever I listen to and I want to listen to whatever I read. Certainly in the beginning period that's what I like doing. The other thing is I listen to things that I like. I listen to content where I like the voice, I listen to things that I'm interested in. So I very much like to do what I like to do and that keeps me going.

I know there are some people who like to speak right away.

I don't like doing that, so I don't do it. There are some people who like to write, who like to answer questions. I hate answering questions, drills, find the verb, redo this sentence, comprehension questions about what I have listened to or read. Some people like to translate. I know Luca, who is an excellent polyglot, likes to translate what he has just listened to into his own language. I don't like doing that.

I think to be a successful language learner you have to enjoy the process, you have to put in the time, so you have to decide what it is you like doing.

Do you like listening and reading? Do you like watching videos? Do you like just going out and hanging out with people, if that opportunity is available to you? As I said, personally, I don't like doing a lot of speaking until I have enough of the language, enough words, enough familiarity with the language, but others do.

So it is important to do what you like to do, that's going to be a major condition for success because if you like doing it then all of a sudden it's the process of language learning that becomes its own reward.

As one LingQ member said when I met him in Osaka, Japan, “In language learning there is no finish line. It's the process itself that is the reward, if we do what we like to do.”

So that's my second secret.

In language learning do what you like to do, but continue doing it.`,

        content: `Hi, there, it's Steve Kaufmann Founder of LingQ and I'm going to talk to you about the third of my Secrets to Successful Language Learning.

The first one was to spend the time every day and for as long as it takes. The second secret was to do things that you like to do in language learning. That will insure your success and insure that you stay with it. The third secret is to notice what is happening in the language. This is extremely important. Now, how do you develop the ability to notice? There are a number of things that you need to do. First of all, I would like to stress that the ability to notice is probably the largest difference, the most significant difference between people who are good at language learning and people who are not good at language learning, so it's very important to develop the ability to notice.

Now, the first thing you need to do is to make sure you get a lot of exposure to the language through listening, reading or, if you prefer, watching videos, but somehow you have to get a lot of the language into you because you can't notice things that you haven't already experienced. It's a bit like the saying you can only learn what you already know.

It sounds a bit contradictory, but you can't notice until you've actually consciously and subconsciously experienced something. So, hopefully, you are spending a lot of time gaining that exposure to the language. Now, how do you start noticing? There are a number of things that can help you notice. First of all, you have to want to notice.

So if I'm reading, I'll often underline certain expressions or words. If I'm reading at LingQ, I will save words and phrases to my personal database. Just the act of saving them helps me notice. Now, when I review these in flashcards that again helps me notice. It's not because I review them in flashcards that I'm going to remember them, I won't necessarily remember them. Some words I'll remember, some I won't, but it's all slowly building up this ability to notice. If I'm corrected it may help me notice.

It may not, but it certainly won't necessarily correct me. Maybe an explanation from a teacher or an explanation in a grammar book will help me notice. That's why I very often review grammar books very quickly, again, not with the intention or the hope that I'll remember a particular rule or a particular verb ending, but because it's just that process, that continuous cumulative process of getting me to notice certain things. Once I notice something, let's say it was a correction in my writing and then I look for it when I'm reading or when I hear the language, all of a sudden I start to notice these things everywhere.

As we notice things in the language they become a part of us and pretty soon because we've noticed it here and noticed it there, suddenly automatically we start using these words and phrases or patterns of the language more correctly. Now, the same is true with pronunciation.

You can't pronounce what you can't hear, so you have to pay attention to how the language is pronounced. It's not just the individual sounds you need to pay attention to, it's the intonation and sometimes it can be very useful to listen and imitate because that's helping you to notice. So whether it be pronunciation, correct usage or the accumulation of words and phrases, it's very important to hone that ability to notice and it starts with a desire to notice, the conscious determination, will, to say I'm going to try to notice the language and then you can train yourself through these various activities.

So that's the third hint, learn to notice the language and you'll become an efficient and successful language learner.

Thank you.`,

        content: `Hi there, this is Steve Kaufmann Founder of LingQ continuing my series of Seven Secrets to Successful Language Learning.

You'll remember the first one was to spend the time. The second one was to do the things that you like to do in language learning. The third one was to develop and improve your ability to notice what's happening in the language. Now, the fourth one is focus on words. Words – vocabulary - is much more important than grammar. In fact, if you learn words, if you have lots of words and if you learn these words naturally through lots of listening and reading, the grammar will eventually fall into place. Nothing prevents you from occasionally reviewing grammar rules in a small grammar book. It's probably a good thing to do. I do it, but my major emphasis is accumulating words. That's why at LingQ our number one measurable is how many words do you know.

Now, some people say that the emphasis should be on learning chunks of words in the form of phrases that we can easily reproduce.

Certainly, this is a good thing to do, but the phrases themselves consist of words so you still have to know what words mean and you can't learn them in isolation. You have to learn them from meaningful content and that's why when I save a word to my personal database at LingQ not only do I capture all the phrases where that word occurs, but the next time that word appears in any new text at LingQ it will be highlighted in yellow. So I'm constantly working to increase my known words total at LingQ.

Grammar, which is nothing other than a description of correct usage, is something that develops gradually.

If you try to memorize the rules of grammar and even if you were able to learn the rules, which I think is very difficult to do without a sufficient amount of input, if you didn't have enough of a vocabulary to follow a conversation in a particular area or to express your ideas then you would not be able to say very much. On the other hand, if you have a large vocabulary you will be surprised. Especially if you've seen these words in different phrases, you'll start to notice how naturally you start to speak with the words in the correct order and in the correct form.

So, once again, focus your efforts on words and there are a number of strategies that can help you.

Some people like to use flashcards and there's Anki, SuperMemo and other such methods out there. My own preference is to do a lot of listening and reading and I will focus my listening and reading. As I said in a previous video, as much as possible I will try to read what I'm listening to and listen to what I'm reading. I will also focus on one author during a particular period or on one subject area, which might be politics, history or economics.

What this does is it insures that a certain range of words appear more frequently.

Because I'm staying with one author, Tolstoy for example in Russian, then I become familiar with his vocabulary. If I am listening to current event interviews, then I become very familiar with that vocabulary. So, occasionally, I'll change my emphasis, change the author, change the subject area, but always try to focus for a certain period of time on one particular area so that I get enough repetition so that I can accumulate my vocabulary.

So there you have it, secret No.

4, focus on words and the rest of it will fall into place. Thank you for listening.`,

        content: `Hi, there, this is Steve Kaufmann Founder of LingQ and today I'm gonna talk about the fifth Secret to Successful Language Learning.

Again, you'll remember that so far we've discussed the need to spend a lot of time, enough time, an hour a day for quite a long period of time. The second secret was to do things that you like to do in the language. The third secret was to develop the ability to notice what's happening in the language, which all good language learners have. The fourth thing was to focus on words, vocabulary rather than grammar. Now, the fifth secret is to be patient, patient.

I see more frustrated language learners who get upset because they forget words.

They get upset because they don't understand. Even after listening many, many times to the same content, certain parts of it they just don't understand or they watch a movie many times and they can't understand it. Let me tell you, that is absolutely normal. You will have and continue to have times when you find it difficult to say what you want to say. Maybe the day before you felt you were doing very well and all of a sudden you can't say what you want to say and that is absolutely normal.

It's important to realize that the brain is constantly learning and there are a number of books that I've read about how the brain learns.

The brain will constantly learn and it's constantly changing and renewing itself. However, it does so on its own schedule, so just because you've studied something doesn't mean you're going to learn it. However, you have to be confident as you continue and persevere in your studies and that you're doing things you like to do, which in my case is listening and reading. Even if I'm talking to people, of course I'm listening and I'm noticing.

All of this is gradually improving my capability in the language, so you have to accept that and it's not going to be overnight.

It may take six months for certain things to sink in, but all of a sudden they do. Almost without realizing it (and I've had this feeling), I'll go back to a text that I struggled with two-three months, four months earlier and it seemed that I never made any progress, I could never understand certain parts of it and all of a sudden lo and behold! it's crystal clear to me.

Similarly, in speaking you have these moments of great triumph when you were in a discussion and lo and behold! you were able to express your ideas just the way you wanted to or almost.

Maybe the next day you won't be so successful, but it's a very gradual process. It's not obvious which words or which structures in the language the brain is going to learn first or later, so you just have to be patient and you have to believe that what you're doing is going to lead to the desired result.

Anytime you get frustrated, upset, because you forgot something or because you don't understand something, all these negative thoughts are very damaging to the learning process.

Again, I'm not a neuroscientist, but there is so much emotion in how the brain learns that it's very important not to get negative and to be patient. Realize that it's a long road, hopefully an enjoyable road, but one that will definitely lead to fluency in that language. Fluency need not mean perfection, so if you don't expect perfection but you do expect to constantly improve, then I think you can afford to be patient.

So that's my fifth secret, be patient.

Thank you for listening.`,

        content: `Hi, there, this is Steve Kaufmann Founder LingQ continuing in my series of Seven Secrets to Successful Language Learning.

Again, I'll review them, as I always do. The first one was to spend the time. The second one was to do things you like to do in language learning. The third thing was to develop the ability to notice what's happening in the language. The fourth secret was to focus on words rather than grammar. The fifth secret was to be patient. Now, the sixth secret is a matter of strategy or tactics, if you want. That is, make sure you get the tools you need to be successful.

If you're fixing something up around the house you need the proper tools.

Any job is easier if you have the proper tools. So, obviously, you need to have an mp3 player. I don't want to promote any one brand, but I have an iPod Touch and I have an iPod Shuffle, which is a smaller mp3 player that is more convenient when I go jogging and it's lighter. The iPod Touch has a number of advantages. On my iPod Touch I have bought online dictionaries for the iPod in 12 different languages. I try the free dictionaries and if they're no good, then I spend the money to get a good dictionary.

Also, I think you should buy books.

Obviously, we at LingQ feel that we have a wonderful platform for language learning, but I would be surprised if most of our members don't also buy books. You can also borrow them, that's fine. A book will last you a long time. It's not a big investment, whereas language learning is a major investment of your time. So I would suggest anyone beginning in a language should buy one of these beginner series.

If you're and English speaker, then there is the Teach Yourself Series or the Colloquial Series.

There's Assimil, which is available for French speakers and English speakers. There are a number of these starter books, get one. I will often buy one or two. While my main interest is listening and reading to the dialogue, I also flip through it for some of the explanations never expecting to remember them, but as sort of a gradual refresher that helps me notice.

Audio books, I'll buy a quality audio book rather than rely on LibriVox where the quality can be uncertain.

I admit that I have an iPad. I use the LingQ app on the iPad and I love it. I can click on my yellow words, I can listen to the audio portion of the lesson, but not everyone is going to spend the money on an iPad. All I'm saying is don't think you can do everything for free, you may end up spending more time trying to work around or using less than satisfactory tools. So whatever your budget is, make sure you have the proper tools.

Online dictionaries, for example, if there are free ones available get them.

If that's good enough, fine, but if you have to spring for $5 to get a good online dictionary or a dictionary for your iPod, do it.

EBooks, whatever, do make sure you get the proper tools.

It's going to make a big difference to your success.

Thank you for listening and we've got one more secret to go.`,

        content: `Hi there, Steve Kaufmann here again with the seventh in my series of Secrets to Successful Language Learning.

I won't review secrets one to six because I can't remember them here right off the bat and I'll jump right in to the seventh. It's, maybe, the most difficult thing for people to achieve and that is, take charge of your own language learning; become an independent language learner.

I believe that only independent language learners are successful and convert themselves into fluent speakers of another language.

There are millions of people who go to class and most of them don't achieve success, unless they take their learning out of the classroom and pursue the language following some of the secrets, some of the methods that I've suggested in this series, like spending enough time on their own outside the classroom, pursuing things of interest to them, listening and reading, interacting with the language in ways that they like, developing the ability to notice, making sure they have the right tools, being patient with their learning. All these things that I've described in this series of videos are the attributes of an independent learner. You have to become independent.

I hear people all the time saying why does this language go this way, is this right or is that right, what does this mean.

I consider myself an independent language learning having learned 11 and now working on my 12th language, I never ask myself those questions. Either I have a translation handy or I can figure it out by looking words up in an online dictionary or I let it go and I know that eventually this pattern or these words will start to make sense to me.

If I want to look up something to do with grammar it's easy enough to do today.

Just by Googling I can see verb tables or noun declension tables in any language with two clicks. I have a little grammar book that I occasionally leaf through in the different languages, but I don't expect that any teacher has to teach it to me. I can access the language, learn from it and explore it on my own, I don't need structure.

That's essentially how we structured LingQ.

We do divide our content, our lessons into levels of difficulty, but within each level of difficulty you're free to explore whichever content strikes your fancy. Some people have trouble with this unstructured way of learning, but that's how people learn in real life. So if you haven't already done so, I would invite you to come to LingQ (LingQ.com) and explore what we have done, what we have created for the independent language learner and I look forward to meeting you there.

Thank you for listening to this series and goodbye for now.`,
